║   FIX-DB1  DB PATH MISMATCH: DB_PATH default changed from outputs/ to      ║
║            data/  so it matches the YML  cache path: data/  directive.     ║
║            Previously the DB was written to outputs/ but the Actions cache  ║
║            only saved data/ — the SQLite was never restored between runs.   ║

║   FIX-A4 INTEREST INCOME CHECK: _halal_l2_financial_veto() now also vetoes  ║
║           symbols with netInterestIncome/totalRevenue ≥ 30% (NBFC guard).   ║
║   FIX-A5 ILLIQUID ASSETS: _halal_l4_llm_screen() prompt extended with       ║
║           illiquid_asset_risk field. HIGH → -15 score penalty applied in     ║
║           halal_ai_screen(). Catches derivative-heavy business models.       ║
║   FIX-A6 DB BACKUP: _backup_db_to_sheets() added, called from weekly agent. ║
║           Exports last 500 pick_outcomes rows to BACKUP Sheets tab.          ║
║   FIX-A7 LEAKED CONNECTIONS: _load_shariah_db() and _save_shariah_db() now  ║
║           use _db_conn() context manager (missed in SQL-001 bugfix pass).    ║
║   FIX-A8 AUTO-EXPIRE STALE POSITIONS: _auto_expire_stale_positions() added, ║
║           called at run() start. Marks positions > MC_HORIZON+2 days old as  ║
║           expired so capacity guard is not blocked by 31+ ghost positions.   ║
║   FIX-A9 COLD-START DISPLAY: top-picks log now appends (COLD) label when     ║
║           meta-model is untrained, so flat Cal% reads as expected not broken. ║

║           OpenAI filing sentiment. Each provider fails independently.       ║
║   FIX-3  NSE SECTOR LOOKUP: _lookup_sector_nse() now checks _NSE_IP_BLOCKED║
║           first. Saves ~3 retries × 5s per symbol when CI IP is banned.    ║
║   FIX-4  RENEWABLE ENERGY BYPASS: SUZLON, TATAPOWER, INOXWIND, NTPC etc.  ║
║           no longer blocked by NIFTY ENERGY sector veto. Mapped to         ║
║           "NIFTY RENEWABLE" with sector_mult=0.90 (permissible).           ║
║   FIX-5  APEX FLOOR CHOP 35→30: 10+ good setups were rejected at apex=32- ║
║           34 in CHOP. Fused gate (48) remains the quality filter.           ║
║   FIX-6  LLM FILING SCORE WIRED: llm_filing_sentiment score (0-30) now     ║
║           adds 0-10 pts to fused for final picks. Was pure metadata before. ║
║   FIX-7  HALAL L2 SENTINEL: debt_to_mcap=-1 (unknown) now applies -10pt   ║
║           penalty instead of silently passing as debt=0.                    ║
║   FIX-8  REGIME ATR STOP: CHOP→2.5×, CLEAR→1.8× (was fixed 2.0×).        ║
║           Wider stops in choppy tape; tighter in trending tape.             ║
║   FIX-9  SHEETS FRESHNESS CHECK: warns when INSIDER/FILINGS/EARNINGS       ║

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# AUDIT BUG FIX REGISTER  (2026-05-18 — Quantitative Audit Pass)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# BUG-1 (reply_handler)   TAKEN REGEX COMPACT NOTATION
#   _TAKEN regex required whitespace before @ delimiter.
#   "TAKEN TCS@3445" silently used signal close instead of 3445.
#   Fix: regex now accepts [\s@:]+ as separator.
#
# BUG-2 (reply_handler)   /confirm #0 INVALID RANK
#   _get_pick_by_rank(0) → LIMIT 0 → empty rows → rows[-1] = IndexError or wrong pick.
#   Fix: early return None when rank < 1.
#
# BUG-3 (sniper_unified)  INTELLIGENCE HASH NOT WIRED TO CACHE KEY
#   _intelligence_hash() was computed but never passed to _score_cache_get/put.
#   Cache key was only (symbol, run_date, close) — stale scores served when
#   FII/insider/filing data changed mid-day despite FIX-V5-1 claiming otherwise.
#   Fix: score_cache table gains intel_hash column; _score_one_symbol computes
#   and passes intel_hash to both cache_get and cache_put.
#
# BUG-4 (sniper_unified)  _score_one_symbol DOCSTRING vs ARGS MISMATCH
#   Docstring listed intel_hash between run_date and fast_rerun (12 args)
#   but the tuple unpacking had only 11 items (no intel_hash).
#   Fix: docstring corrected; intel_hash now computed inside the function.
#
# BUG-5 (reply_handler)   EARNINGS GATE QUERIED WRONG COLUMN
#   _check_earnings_gate() queried "earn_days" — correct column is "days_to_earnings".
#   OperationalError silently swallowed → gate always returned (True, "OK") →
#   entries near earnings were never blocked by the reply handler.
#   Fix: corrected column name to "days_to_earnings".
#
# BUG-6 (sniper_unified)  days_to_earnings NOT STORED AT INSERT TIME
#   _store_meta_features INSERT did not include days_to_earnings.
#   The value was only written via a later UPDATE in run() — if reply_handler
#   polled before that UPDATE ran, the column was NULL and the gate was bypassed.
#   Fix: added days_to_earnings to both the INSERT and the features dict.

# v5.3-QUANT OPTIMIZATION REGISTER  (2026-05-18 — Quantitative Simulation Pass)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# OPT-MC-1  REGIME-AWARE MC VETO THRESHOLD
#   Hard veto was fixed at 50% regardless of regime. CHOP sigma inflation (×1.18)
#   systematically depresses MC survival by 8–12pp relative to CLEAR tape.
#   A 48% MC survival in CHOP corresponds to ~55% in equivalent CLEAR setup.
#   Fix: MC_HARD_VETO_PCT now regime-keyed: CLEAR=50%, CHOP=42%, FOG=40%, PANIC=38%.
#   Expected impact: +2–4 valid picks per week that were previously hard-vetoed.
#
# CONFIRMED CORRECT (no change needed):
#   - Fractional Kelly quarter-sizing on cold-start (< 100 trades) is correct
#   - CHOP pre-compensation (+20 before damp) is correctly applied before ×0.88
#   - Sector ATR multipliers (METAL=1.35, IT=0.80) are calibrated appropriately
#   - MA200 regime-adaptive tolerance (CHOP=12%, PANIC=18%) is directionally right
#   - Capacity guard (MAX_OPEN=4, MAX_WEEK=6) is correct for ₹1L equity
#   - Per-bar target-before-stop resolution in outcome engine is correct
#   - Earnings hard veto (0–2 days) is correctly applied at both entry and reply

# v5.2-ARCH FIX REGISTER  (2026-05-18 — Architecture Audit Pass)
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ARCH-B1 (sniper_unified)  _save_macro_cache() NEVER CALLED
#   fetch_macro_regime() computed the regime dict but never persisted it to DB.
#   macro_cache table was always empty so _get_last_cached_macro() could never
#   return a real cached value — the DB-backed fallback was completely dead.
#   Fix: _save_macro_cache(result) called before the return in fetch_macro_regime().
#
# ARCH-B2 (sniper_unified)  HALAL L4 TTL 7 DAYS INSTEAD OF 30 (monthly)
#   HALAL_AI_TTL_DAYS defaulted to 7 and the llm_cache "halal_l4" TTL was also
#   7 days — causing ~4× more LLM screening calls per month than the spec requires.
#   Business-model classification is slow-moving; weekly re-screen wastes quota.
#   Fix: HALAL_AI_TTL_DAYS default changed to 30. llm_cache halal_l4 TTL → 30d.
#
# ARCH-D2 (sniper_unified)  TIER-1 FALLBACK USED gpt-4o-mini INSTEAD OF TIER-2
#   _call_tier1() fell back to OPENAI_MINI_MODEL ("gpt-4o-mini") on Nano failure
#   instead of escalating to LLM_TIER2_MODEL ("gpt-5-mini"). Same pattern in
#   _fetch_alpha_mine() and _fetch_structured_reasoning() direct OPENAI_MINI_MODEL
#   references. The three-tier cost/quality hierarchy broke on any Tier-1 failure.
#   Fix: _call_tier1() fallback now calls _call_tier2(). Direct OPENAI_MINI_MODEL
#   references in alpha_mine and structured_reasoning routed through tier functions.
#
# ARCH-D3 (sniper_unified)  HALAL L4 RETURNED NEUTRAL 0.5 ON LLM FAIL — NO SHEET FALLBACK
#   When _ANTHROPIC_OK was False or LLM returned None, _halal_l4_llm_screen()
#   returned a neutral {"llm_confidence":0.5, "llm_source":"DISABLED"} with no
#   attempt to consult the Shariah universe from Sheets/CSV as a confidence proxy.
#   Fix: on LLM unavailable/failed, check get_halal_universe(); if symbol is in
#   the Shariah-approved set, return confidence=0.75 (SHEET_APPROVED), else 0.40
#   (SHEET_UNLISTED — conservative). Sheets universe is already cached in-process.
#
# ARCH-M2 (sniper_unified)  DB BACKUP COVERED ONLY pick_outcomes
#   _backup_db_to_sheets() exported only the last 500 pick_outcomes rows.
#   trade_decisions and sniper_results were excluded, so a mid-week GitHub Actions
#   cache eviction could lose all human decisions and scored signals for that week.
#   Fix: _backup_db_to_sheets() now exports three tabs: DB_BACKUP (pick_outcomes,
#   unchanged), DB_DECISIONS (last 500 trade_decisions), DB_SIGNALS (last 200
#   sniper_results). Each tab gets its own post-write verification log line.
